This library is inspired by other libraries that utilize the child function pattern in order to allow the consumer to generate React components for pagination that cover her specific use cases. Other drop-in pagination libraries assume control over rendering which limits the viability of:
- Using alternate styling patterns (JSS, Styled Components)
- Managing markup for design or accessibility purposes
- Extending the library to cover use cases that the author did not consider or support

Check out the examples folder for inspiration.

More coming soon.
